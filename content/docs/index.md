## What is Lithia.js?

Lithia.js is a next-generation framework for building high-performance server-side applications with Node.js. Engineered for modern development workflows, it combines minimalism with powerful capabilities out of the box.

:br

Built entirely on Node.js core modules with zero external dependencies, Lithia.js leverages the native `http` module for unparalleled performance. Our integrated toolchain eliminates configuration overhead through:

- Intelligent code bundling and compilation
- Automated production optimizations
- Built-in API documentation generation
- TypeScript-native development environment

:br

Whether you're prototyping a startup idea or architecting enterprise solutions, Lithia.js streamlines your workflow from first commit to production deployment.

## Why Choose Lithia.js?

Traditional Node.js frameworks require extensive setup before writing business logic. Lithia.js redefines this paradigm through our zero-configuration philosophy:

:br

**Competitor Workflow**  
❌ Install multiple dependencies  
❌ Configure bundlers/transpilers  
❌ Manual API documentation setup  
❌ Complex routing configurations  
❌ Hours spent on project setup

:br

**Lithia.js Workflow**  
✅ Single-command project scaffolding  
✅ TypeScript support out of the box  
✅ Automatic OpenAPI documentation  
✅ File-system based routing  
✅ Production-ready 20x faster

:br

Focus on innovation while we handle the rest:

- **Smart Routing System**: Intuitive file-based routing with dynamic parameter support
- **Integrated Bundler**: Optimized production builds with tree-shaking and minification
- **API Documentation**: Automatically generated OpenAPI documentation for your endpoints
- **Dev Mode**: Instantly preview changes with hot module replacement
- **TypeScript First**: Native ESM support with zero-config TS compilation

:br

In an era of complex toolchains, the real question becomes: **Why complicate when you can simplify?**
