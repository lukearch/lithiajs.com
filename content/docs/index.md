## What is Lithia.js?

Lithia.js is a Node.js framework for building server-side applications. It is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use.

:br

Under the hood, Lithia.js does not use any external dependencies and is built on top of the built-in Node.js `http` module.
It also provides a set of toolings, like bundling, compiling, and mode. This allows you to focus on building your application
instead of spending time configuring your project.

:br

Even if you're an individual developer or a team, Lithia.js can help you build your application faster and more efficiently.

Trust us, you'll love it!
