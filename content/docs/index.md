Welcome to Lithia.js documentation!

## What is Lithia.js?

Lithia.js is a Node.js framework for building server-side applications. It is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use.

:br

Under the hood, Lithia.js does not use any external dependencies and is built on top of the built-in Node.js `http` module.
It also provides a set of toolings, like bundling, compiling, and mode. This allows you to focus on building your application
instead of spending time configuring your project.

:br

Even if you're an individual developer or a team, Lithia.js can help you build your application faster and more efficiently.

::br

Trust us, you'll love it!

## Why Lithia.js?

Lithia.js was created to make the development process easier and faster, without all the boilerplate code and configurations that you usually need to set up when building a Node.js application.

:br

When you choose any other framework, you need to install a lot of dependencies, configure your project, and set up a lot of things before you can start building your application. With Lithia.js, you can start building your application right away, without worrying about all these things.

:br

It's literally as simple as running `create-lithia-app --yes` and then `npm run dev` without any additional configurations.
All ready, all set!

:br

Lithia.js takes care of all the heavy lifting for you, so you can focus on what really matters.

:br

- We simplify **routing** so you don't have to **manage it**.
- We provide a **built-in bundler** so you don't have to **configure it**.
- We provide a **built-in OpenAPI module** so you don't have to **doc by yourself**.
- We already **documented everything** so you don't have to **figure it out**.
- We already **configure your project** so you don't have to **waste your time** doing it.

:br

We almost do everything for you, so the correct question should be: **Why not Lithia.js?**
