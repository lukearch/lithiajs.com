## What is Lithia.js?

Lithia.js is a next-generation framework for building high-performance server-side applications with Node.js. Engineered for modern development workflows, it combines minimalism with powerful capabilities out of the box.

:br

Built entirely on Node.js core modules with zero external dependencies, Lithia.js leverages the native `http` module for unparalleled performance. Our integrated toolchain eliminates configuration overhead through:

:br

- Intelligent code bundling and compilation
- Automated production optimizations
- Built-in API documentation generation
- TypeScript-native development environment

:br

Whether you're prototyping a startup idea or architecting enterprise solutions, Lithia.js streamlines your workflow from first commit to production deployment.
